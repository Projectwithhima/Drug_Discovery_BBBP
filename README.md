# Drug_Discovery_BBBP
This repository contains a complete pipeline for predicting blood–brain barrier permeability (BBBP) of small molecules using classical machine learning, deep learning, and graph neural networks. The project combines RDKit-based molecular descriptor engineering, robust preprocessing, and multiple models to screen CNS‑relevant compounds from the ChEMBL36 database.
